	  Elementary is a widget set based on the EFL
	  that makes heavy use of Evas and Edje to
	  provide a fast, stable, and scalable library
	  that can be used to create both rich and fast
	  applications that can be used on anything from
	  every day desktop computers to small PDAs and
	  set-top boxes. It is designed to fully expose
	  the capability of the EFL.
