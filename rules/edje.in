	  Edje is a library that attempts to separate
	  the user interface from the application. It
	  allows applications to be skinnable, so that
	  it is possible to change the GUI of an application
	  without changing the application itself.
	  Edje-based applications use files which contain the
	  specifications for the GUI layout that is to be used.
	  Edje themes are contained using EET generated files.
