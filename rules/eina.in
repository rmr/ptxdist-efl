	  Eina is the base library of all data types used by the EFL.
	  It is designed to reduce CPU use as much as possible without
	  using too much memory. It provides
	  * list and inlined
	  * hash
	  * red-black tree
	  * shared string
	  * rectangle
	  * array iterator and accessor
	  * memory pool
	  * module
	  * fixed point and magic check helper.
	  The library itself is small and could easily be used without
	  any other EFL libraries.
