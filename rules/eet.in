	  EET is a library that is designed to store and load
	  all type of data, locally or through a network stream.
	  It is designed to be light-weight, efficient and quick.
	  EET forms the basis of theme files in the EFL, i.e.
	  if you want to install a theme for Enlightenment or
	  another themable EFL app, you would be installing
	  an EET-format file, which contains all of the theme graphics
	  and configuration and do not need to be extracted onto the
	  filesystem in order to be used.
